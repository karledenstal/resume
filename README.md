# Karl Codes

Web development isn't just a job - it's a lifestyle.

This resum√© was built using Astro, TailwindCSS and React, and deployed neatly to netlify. Super easy to set up, super fun to work in.

I pride myself on writing clean and easy to read code that any developer can easily get into, and I love experimenting with new frameworks and ideas.

Performance, stability and maintainability are my main concerns for building websites and three things that I'm really invested in.

I also like mentoring & helping out junior colleagues, helping them improve their knowledge as well as write nice, efficient code.
